# Fanuc

[ROS-Industrial][] Fanuc meta-package. See the [ROS wiki][] page for more 
information.

Some additional packages can be found in the [fanuc_experimental][] repository.


## Contents

Development in this repository is focused on ROS versions after Groovy, but 
its packages can still be installed from source on a Groovy installation.
For the code of the rosbuild version released into Groovy (0.1.1), see the 
[subversion repository][].
